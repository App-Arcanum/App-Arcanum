  <b>To prove the reliability of Arcanum App, it was tested on a high-performance monster machine:</b><br>
  ⚡ Ultra-fast CPU with <b>128 threads</b> and a staggering <b>528 GB RAM</b>.<br><br>
  
  <b>Transparency is absolute:</b><br>
  ✅ 100% of the code is fully open and visible.<br>
  ✅ Every logo, icon, and design element is created entirely by me.<br>
  ✅ Only external components: essential Python libraries.<br><br>
  
  <b>Core Values of Arcanum App:</b><br>
  🔒 Security first: State-of-the-art AES-256 & RSA-2048 encryption.<br>
  🌍 Built with passion, knowledge, and the vision of global communication freedom.<br>
  ⚔️ Inspired by legends, designed for the future.<br><br>
